    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Rajiba Lochan Sahoo, a postgraduate student specializing in Engineering Mathematics at the Institute of Chemical Technology (ICT), Mumbai. My academic journey has been deeply rooted in mathematics, which has fueled my passion for solving complex problems using quantitative methods.</p>
    <p>My primary interests lie in Machine Learning, Applied Statistics, and Mathematical Problem Solving. I am particularly fascinated by how these fields can be applied to real-world challenges.</p>
    <p>Currently, I am honing my skills in programming languages like R and tools like Quarto to analyze data and develop models that can provide actionable insights. I am eager to leverage these skills in practical applications that can make a tangible difference.</p>
    <p>Beyond academics, I am an avid learner and constantly seek opportunities to expand my knowledge and expertise. I am enthusiastic about collaborating on projects that align with my interests and contribute to meaningful advancements in technology and society.</p>
